 Find Integer  EASY Level

You are given two integers, ‘N’ and ‘K’. Assume numbers from 1 to ‘N’ are 
arranged such that all odd numbers (in ascending order) are present 
first and then come to all even numbers (also in ascending order).


You need to find the integer at position ‘K’ (numbering of positions starts from 1).
For example:
You are given ‘N’ as 7 and ‘K’ as 4.  Numbers from 1 to 7 are arranged as [1, 3, 5, 7, 2, 4, 6], and the number at position 4 is 7. So, the answer is 7. 
Constraints:
1 <= T <= 10
1 <= N <= 10^12
1 <= K <= N
Sample Input 1:
2
7 4
5 3

Sample Output 1:
7
5
Explanation:
For the first test case, the numbers from 1 to 7 are arranged as [1, 3, 5, 7, 2, 4, 6], and the number at position 4 is 7. Hence the answer is 7.
For the second test case, the numbers from 1 to 5 are arranged as [1, 3, 5, 2, 4], and the number at position 3 is 5. Hence the answer is 5.

Sample Input 2:
2
6 2
7 3

Sample Output 2:
3
5
